  desc: I am a student at Silesian University of Technology, Poland. Besides the studies, I mostly perform data analysis in projects for Healthcare connected to my university. I try to not only master the languages and technologies connected to this area, but also involve universal software solutions in my projects. I plan on continuing my Machine Learning journey while implementing good habits from other domains as well.  # Describe yourself.
